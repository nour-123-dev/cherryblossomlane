        <td>Tea Ceremony</td>
        <td>The Japanese tea ceremony, or chanoyu, is an ancient tradition that emphasizes hospitality, 
          respect, and mindfulness. It’s not just about drinking tea—it’s about creating an experience 
          that engages all the senses. The ritualistic preparation and sharing of matcha offer a 
          meditative pause from the chaos of daily life, reflecting the Japanese ethos of harmony and 
          simplicity.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Calligraphy</td>
        <td>Japanese calligraphy, known as shodo, is a refined art form that transcends mere handwriting.
           With every stroke, calligraphers express emotions and philosophies, turning characters into 
           flowing works of art. It’s an art of patience and precision, where the ink’s movement on 
           paper is seen as a reflection of the writer’s soul.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Origami</td>
        <td>Origami, the delicate art of paper folding, is a symbol of creativity, patience, and 
          precision in Japanese culture. With just a single sheet of paper, intricate designs come to 
          life—from simple cranes to complex flowers and animals. Each fold represents careful thought 
          and the mastery of technique, making origami a reflection of the beauty found in simplicity 
          and focus.</td>
        <td><img src="origami.jpg" alt="Origami" class="image-style"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Kimono</td>
        <td>The kimono is a timeless symbol of Japanese culture, renowned for its intricate design and 
          ceremonial significance. Worn during festivals, weddings, and other special occasions, the 
          kimono’s beauty lies in its delicate fabric, elegant patterns, and cultural symbolism. Each 
          kimono tells a story, with its colors and patterns often representing specific seasons or 
          celebrations.</td>
        <td><img src="kimono.jpg" alt="Kimono" class="image-style"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ikebana</td>
        <td>Ikebana is the Japanese art of flower arranging, where the placement of each stem, leaf, 
          and blossom holds deep symbolic meaning. This practice celebrates nature’s beauty through 
          minimalistic yet powerful compositions, emphasizing balance, harmony, and the fleeting beauty 
          of life. It’s more than arranging flowers—it’s a form of meditation that connects one with 
          nature’s rhythms.</td>
